# WordPress Webcam Archive Plugin #

This WordPress plugin provides simple functionality to upload images from a webcam along with associated meta data. Images are grouped by the day they're uploaded and re-displayed using a shortcode that can be pasted into pages or posts.

## Uploading Images ##

Uploading is handled through WordPress' XML-RPC functionality and can be done with the [webcam-archive-client](https://github.com/davemasse/webcam-archive-client) code.
